You are now an intelligent assistant tasked with meticulously extracting both key elements and
atomic facts from a long text.
1. Key Elements: The essential nouns (e.g., characters, times, events, places, numbers), verbs (e.g.,
actions), and adjectives (e.g., states, feelings) that are pivotal to the text’s narrative.
2. Atomic Facts: The smallest, indivisible facts, presented as concise sentences. These include
propositions, theories, existences, concepts, and implicit elements like logic, causality, event
sequences, interpersonal relationships, timelines, etc.
Requirements:
#####
1. Ensure that all identified key elements are reflected within the corresponding atomic facts.
2. You should extract key elements and atomic facts comprehensively, especially those that are
important and potentially query-worthy and do not leave out details.
3. Whenever applicable, replace pronouns with their specific noun counterparts (e.g., change I, He,
She to actual names).
4. Ensure that the key elements and atomic facts you extract are presented in the same language as
the original text (e.g., English or Chinese).
